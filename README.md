# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
Predicting the price of a house based on their features (no of bedrooms, no of bathrooms, square footage etc.) using a deep learning model.
The data was explored by using visualization techniques and statistical analysis such as:
•	Checking for null values
•	Using the describe method to view the data’s statistical analysis
•	Used seaborn’s distribution plot to visualize the price feature (since it’s a continuous label) which showed that the house prices mostly fall between 0-1.5 million dollars and some outliers for the extremely expensive houses.
•	used a count plot to visualize the most common number of rooms most houses in the data usually has (between 2-5)
•	used the correlation method to check for correlations between the data features.
•	Explored more on the data’s highly correlated features using a scatterplot for e.g. house price and living space, and this showed the more the living space, the more the house price.
•	Dropped some outliers in the data by removing the top 1 percent of the most expensive houses I.e they are the house prices with 1 or 2 frequency in the data. 
•	Used a scatter plot to show the relation between the house price and the latitude and longitudes of the house. This helped reveal the locations with the most expensive house prices.
•	A box plot was used to show the price difference between houses located at waterfront and houses not located in a waterfront.
